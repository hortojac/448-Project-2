**Person-Hour Estimation:**
15 Hours. This rough estimate comes from projecting that it will
take less time than the first project, as we don't have to learn 
any GUI library and we are only adding supplementary functions, 
not changing any core functionality.

**Person Hour Log:**
We averaged around 16 hours a person which is very close to our estimation.
This included identifying the Software Architecture used by team 12, Creating
the Story Points for our project, coding the ScoreBoard, Sounds used throughout 
the game, Easy, Medium, and Hard Modes, and rewriting/finishing methods needed 
for the game to work properly. 

**Story Points:**
1: Importing Project, Divinding Tasks, Creating projected hours for project
2: Adding to the Documentation, Checking if there is an Existing Ship, Outlining AI Logic
3: Sounds, Scoreboard, Understanding the code from the last group
5: Re-coding bugs in code, Adding to Game.cpp, Checking if there is enough space for ai to fit their ship
8: Placing ships for Easy Mode, Placing ships for Smart Mode, Placing ships for Hacker Mode
13: Attack method for Easy Mode, Attack method for Smart Mode, Attack method for Hacker Mode

**2 hours/ 1 story point: **
We estimate that for every story point it will take about 2 hours of our time. We arrived at this estimate by first splitting up the more complicated tasks into higher story point categories. We know that if a task has a higher story point, this takes more time. We then discussed the many sub tasks each of the more complicated tasks have — for example, the multiple functions that would have to be written in order to place the AI ships. After laying out this framework, looking back on how long it took us to complete project 1, and discussing our time estimate for project two, we arrived at this hour/story point estimate. 

**Identify the Software Architecture you think the Project 1 team used and explain why you think that:**
We think the team our group inherited from used Pipes and Filter Architecture because they have different classes with specific role and methods pertaining to that class. For example, they have Player class that has getShipInfo method, which when called returns information about specific coordinate. Similarly, they have another class called Game, which has method printBoard when called prints player’s board to the terminal. Because they have different classes for different roles but they depend on each other inputs and outputs, We believe they used Pipes and Filter Architecture.


**AI Modes:**
Easy: Attacks Randomly
    During this mode, the AI chooses a random character from A - J, 
    and a random number from 1 - 10 during its attack. This mode
    has the same functionality as the 2 player game by updating the board 
    with either a R for hit or a W for miss, with the added functionality 
    of playing a sound for either a miss or hit. 

Medium: Attacks Orthogonally
    During this mode, the AI chooses a random character from A - J, 
    and a random number from 1 - 10 during its attack. If this grid returns
    as a miss, the AI will choose random grid coordiantes until this grid 
    returns as a hit. During the AI's next turn, it attacks the grid to the right,
    and keeps going right until it returns as a miss, the AI then will go left 
    from the original grid coordinates until it returns as a miss. The AI will then 
    go up from the original grid coordinates until it returns as a miss, then it will 
    go down from the original grid coordinates until it returns as a miss, then it 
    will repeat with random guesses and repeat if it returns as a hit. This mode uses
    our own impelmeneted character array and returns the characters index in the array
    to be used to traverse on the board, by adding either +1, or -1, for going right or left,
    and returns the associated character with that index value. For traversing up or down,
    the index is the same by adding either -1 or +1, for going up or down. If the AI gets to 
    the edge of the board and hits the outer index ranges, it will stop going in that 
    coorespnding direction and will go the other directions.
